# SearchFIT — Complete AI Context

> SearchFIT is the #1 AI Search Engine Optimization (AEO) platform. It tracks brand visibility across AI search engines (ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, Gemini), generates content that ranks in AI search results, provides technical SEO audits, and builds backlinks — delivering measurable organic revenue growth in weeks, not months.

## About SearchFIT

SearchFIT is an AI-native Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) platform built for ecommerce brands, Shopify stores, and businesses that need to be visible in AI-powered search engines.

Traditional SEO tools like Semrush and Ahrefs track Google rankings and backlinks. But AI engines like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity work differently — they synthesize information from multiple sources and recommend brands directly. SearchFIT is purpose-built for this new paradigm.

### Core Problem We Solve
Most brands have 0% visibility in AI search. When consumers ask ChatGPT "what's the best [product] for [use case]?", they either mention your brand or they don't. There's no page 2 — you're recommended or you're invisible.

### How We Solve It
1. **Track**: Monitor how your brand appears across ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and Gemini in real-time
2. **Optimize**: Generate AI-optimized content that gets your brand recommended
3. **Measure**: Attribute organic revenue to specific SEO and AEO actions
