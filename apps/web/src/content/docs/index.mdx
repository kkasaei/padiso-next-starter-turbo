AEO ensures your business is accurately represented when AI systems answer user queries. This includes:

- Being mentioned as a solution to user problems
- Having accurate business information in AI responses
- Being recommended in relevant contexts
- Appearing in AI-generated comparisons and lists

SearchFit provides the tools and insights you need to succeed in both SEO and AEO.
