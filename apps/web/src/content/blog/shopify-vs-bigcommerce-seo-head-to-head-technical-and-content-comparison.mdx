Choosing between Shopify and BigCommerce? SEO capability should be a major factor in your decision. Both platforms power thousands of successful ecommerce stores, but they handle SEO differently in ways that impact your rankings, traffic, and revenue. Here's the unbiased, technical comparison.

‍

## Technical SEO: Feature-by-Feature

| Feature | Shopify | BigCommerce |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Custom URLs | Limited (forced prefixes) | Full control |
| Canonical tags | Automatic | Automatic |
| Robots.txt | Limited editing | Full editing |
| 301 redirects | Built-in bulk import | Built-in bulk import |
| XML sitemaps | Auto-generated | Auto-generated |
| Schema markup | Basic (theme-dependent) | More built-in options |
| Page speed | Very fast (CDN included) | Fast (CDN available) |
| SSL | Included free | Included free |
| AMP support | Via apps | Native support |
| Faceted navigation | App-dependent | Better native handling |

## Where BigCommerce Has the Edge

### URL Flexibility
BigCommerce doesn't force URL prefixes. You can have `/blue-running-shoes/` instead of Shopify's `/products/blue-running-shoes`. For SEO purists, this is cleaner—though Google handles both structures fine.

### Built-in SEO Features
BigCommerce includes more SEO features natively:
- Automatic image optimization
- Built-in schema markup for products
- Customizable robots.txt
- Microdata support out of the box

### Faceted Navigation Handling
BigCommerce handles faceted navigation more gracefully for SEO, with better default canonical and noindex behaviour for filter combinations.

## Where Shopify Has the Edge

### Speed and Infrastructure
Shopify's infrastructure is purpose-built for ecommerce:
- Global CDN included in every plan
- Consistently fast load times
- 99.99% uptime guarantee
- Automatic performance optimization

### App Ecosystem for AI SEO
Shopify's app ecosystem is larger and more AI-focused:
- More AI SEO tools available
- Better API for programmatic content management
- Stronger integration with AI content platforms
- More automation capabilities

### Theme Quality and Performance
Shopify's theme review process ensures higher average quality:
- All themes in the store meet performance standards
- Mobile-first design is standard
- Core Web Vitals compliance is expected

### Content and Blogging
While both platforms offer blogging, Shopify's ecosystem provides more content extension options through apps and integrations.

## AI SEO Readiness: Shopify Wins

For AI-powered SEO specifically, Shopify has a clear advantage:

- **Shopify's Admin API** allows programmatic content updates at scale
- **Metafields** provide structured data storage for AI-generated content
- **Shopify Flow** enables automated SEO workflows
- **Larger ecosystem** of AI-native SEO tools built for Shopify

BigCommerce has API capabilities, but the ecosystem of AI SEO tools is smaller.

## Migration Considerations

### BigCommerce to Shopify
- Plan for URL structure changes
- Map all BigCommerce URLs to new Shopify URLs
- Recreate custom URL structures using redirects
- Expect 2-4 weeks of ranking fluctuation post-migration

### Shopify to BigCommerce
- URL flexibility means you can match old Shopify URLs
- Simpler redirect process for URL-compatible migrations
- Evaluate BigCommerce's app ecosystem for your specific needs

## The Verdict

**Choose Shopify if:** You want the best infrastructure, largest app ecosystem, and strongest AI SEO tool support. You're willing to work around URL limitations.

**Choose BigCommerce if:** You need maximum URL control, native SEO features, and don't want to rely on third-party apps for basic SEO functionality.

**For most ecommerce businesses in 2025**, Shopify's combination of speed, ecosystem, and AI readiness makes it the stronger SEO platform—especially when paired with tools like SearchFit.ai.

## FAQs

- **Does Google prefer Shopify or BigCommerce?**

- **Can I migrate from BigCommerce to Shopify without losing rankings?**
Yes, with proper redirect mapping. Most stores recover within 4-8 weeks. AI tools can automate the redirect process.

Shopify Markets makes international SEO easier than BigCommerce's multi-storefront approach.
