Shopify's URL structure is both a blessing and a curse for SEO. It's clean and consistent, but it creates hidden duplicate content problems that silently erode your rankings. The most common culprit: the `/collections/[name]/products/[product]` vs `/products/[product]` duplicate path issue. Here's everything you need to know—and how to fix it.

‍

## The Shopify URL Problem

Every Shopify product has at least two URLs:
- `/products/blue-running-shoe` (canonical product URL)
- `/collections/running-shoes/products/blue-running-shoe` (collection-context URL)

If a product appears in 5 collections, it has 6 URLs—all showing the same content. Google must decide which one to index, and it doesn't always choose correctly.

## Why This Matters for SEO

- **Authority dilution** — backlinks and internal links may point to different URL versions
- **Crawl waste** — Googlebot crawls the same content multiple times
- **Analytics confusion** — traffic is split across multiple URLs in reporting
- **Inconsistent indexation** — Google might index the collection-context URL instead of the canonical

## Shopify's Built-in Fix (and Its Limitations)

Shopify automatically adds canonical tags pointing collection-context URLs to the `/products/` canonical URL. This helps, but doesn't solve everything:

- Internal links in your theme may still use collection-context URLs
- Some apps generate links with collection paths
- XML sitemap includes only canonical URLs (good), but internal linking may not match
- Google doesn't always respect canonical tags

## How to Audit Your URL Structure

### Step 1: Check Internal Links
Crawl your site and identify all internal links pointing to `/collections/*/products/*` URLs. These should point to `/products/*` instead.

### Step 2: Review Theme Templates
Check your Liquid templates for product URL generation:
- `{{ product.url }}` — returns the canonical `/products/` URL (correct)
- `{{ product.url | within: collection }}` — returns the collection-context URL (avoid for SEO)

### Step 3: Check App-Generated Links
Review any apps that generate product links. Many apps use collection-context URLs.

### Step 4: Verify Canonical Tags
Use Google's URL Inspection tool to confirm Google is respecting your canonical tags for key product pages.

## The Fix: Ensuring Clean URLs

### In Your Theme
Always use `{{ product.url }}` without the `within: collection` filter in templates where SEO matters (product grids, search results, recommended products).

### In Your Navigation
Mega menus and navigation links should point to `/products/` URLs where possible, or to collection pages (not collection-context product URLs).

### In Your Content
Blog posts and editorial content should always link to `/products/` canonical URLs.

### Additional URL Issues to Watch
- **Trailing slashes** — Shopify doesn't use them; ensure consistency
- **Tag pages** — `/collections/all/[tag]` creates additional duplicate collection views; consider noindexing
- **Pagination** — `/collections/shoes?page=2` needs proper handling
- **Variant URLs** — `?variant=12345` parameters need canonical management

## AI-Powered URL Management

AI tools can:
- Crawl your entire store and identify all duplicate URL issues
- Generate redirect maps for any URL changes
- Monitor for new duplicate content as products are added
- Validate canonical tag implementation across all pages

## FAQs

- **Should I worry about this if Shopify adds canonical tags automatically?**
Yes—because internal links still pass authority to the wrong URLs, and Google doesn't always respect canonical hints.

- **Will fixing URL structure immediately improve rankings?**
You should see improvements within 2-4 weeks as Google consolidates signals to the canonical URLs.

- **Can I change Shopify's default URL structure?**
No—Shopify enforces `/products/` and `/collections/` prefixes. You can't change this without going headless. But you can ensure all links and references use the canonical version.

## Conclusion

Shopify's URL structure creates hidden duplicate content issues that silently erode rankings. Auditing your internal links, theme templates, and app-generated URLs—then ensuring everything points to canonical `/products/` URLs—consolidates your SEO authority and improves rankings.
