Autonomous AI coding agents promise to handle complex, multi-step development tasks without constant human oversight. But can they actually manage a full Shopify SEO migration—one of the highest-stakes operations in ecommerce? I tested Devin AI, Claude Code, and Cursor's agent capabilities on real migration tasks. Here's what works, what doesn't, and what still needs a human.

‍

## What Makes Shopify Migrations So Hard

A Shopify SEO migration involves:

- **URL mapping**—matching thousands of old URLs to new Shopify URLs
- **Redirect implementation**—creating 301 redirects without chains or loops
- **Content transfer**—ensuring product descriptions, meta data, and custom content migrate correctly
- **Schema recreation**—rebuilding structured data on the new platform
- **Internal link updates**—fixing hardcoded links that point to old URLs
- **Testing and validation**—verifying everything works before and after launch

One mistake can cause catastrophic traffic loss. This is why migrations typically take 2-4 months with an agency.

## The Three AI Agents Tested

### Devin AI
Cognition's autonomous AI software engineer. Devin can plan, code, debug, and deploy software projects with minimal human intervention.

### Claude Code
Anthropic's AI coding tool that operates in the terminal. It understands codebases, generates code, and modifies files based on natural language instructions.

### Cursor Agents (Composer)
Cursor's multi-step agent mode that can plan and execute complex coding tasks across multiple files with Claude or GPT backing.

## Test 1: URL Redirect Mapping

**Task**: Given a crawl of 5,000 URLs from a WooCommerce site and a Shopify product CSV, create a complete redirect map.

**Devin**: Successfully parsed both files, identified matching products by name and SKU, and produced a clean redirect CSV. Handled edge cases well (discontinued products, URL-encoded characters). Took about 15 minutes autonomously. **Score: 9/10**

**Claude Code**: Produced a working Python script to match URLs, but required two iterations to handle edge cases. The final output was accurate. **Score: 8/10**

**Cursor Agents**: Generated the matching script quickly and handled the file I/O well, but needed manual guidance for some ambiguous product matches. **Score: 7.5/10**

## Test 2: Shopify Theme Schema Implementation

**Task**: Create comprehensive Product JSON-LD schema in Shopify Liquid that pulls from product data, metafields, and reviews.

**Devin**: Generated a complete Liquid snippet with proper schema, but made a minor error in how it accessed review metafields. After flagging the issue, it self-corrected. **Score: 8/10**

**Claude Code**: Produced the most accurate schema on the first attempt. Claude's deep understanding of both schema.org and Shopify Liquid resulted in production-ready code. **Score: 9.5/10**

**Cursor Agents**: Good output that required one small fix for variant handling. The multi-file awareness helped it place the snippet correctly in the theme. **Score: 8.5/10**

## Test 3: Post-Migration Link Validation

**Task**: Crawl the new Shopify site, check all internal links, verify redirects work, and produce a report of issues.

**Devin**: Wrote and executed a comprehensive crawl script autonomously. Found all broken links and redirect chains. Produced a clear report. **Score: 9/10**

**Claude Code**: Produced the crawl script but needed help with execution environment setup. Once running, the results were thorough. **Score: 7.5/10**

**Cursor Agents**: Generated a good crawl script within the IDE. Less capable at autonomous execution since it's primarily an editor tool. **Score: 7/10**

## Test 4: Content Transfer Validation

**Task**: Compare product descriptions between old and new sites, flag any truncated or missing content.

**Devin**: Autonomously scraped both sites, compared content, and identified 23 products with truncated descriptions. Impressive autonomous operation. **Score: 9/10**

**Claude Code**: Needed more guidance but produced accurate comparison scripts. **Score: 8/10**

**Cursor Agents**: Good at generating comparison code but less capable at autonomous scraping and execution. **Score: 7/10**

## Overall Scores

| Task | Devin | Claude Code | Cursor Agents |
|------|-------|-------------|---------------|
| URL redirect mapping | 9/10 | 8/10 | 7.5/10 |
| Schema implementation | 8/10 | 9.5/10 | 8.5/10 |
| Link validation | 9/10 | 7.5/10 | 7/10 |
| Content transfer | 9/10 | 8/10 | 7/10 |
| **Overall** | **8.75** | **8.25** | **7.5** |

## Where AI Agents Excel in Migrations

- **Data processing**—matching, mapping, and validating thousands of URLs
- **Code generation**—writing crawl scripts, redirect files, and schema markup
- **Repetitive validation**—checking every link, every redirect, every page
- **Report generation**—summarizing issues clearly

## Where AI Agents Still Need Humans

- **Strategic decisions**—which URLs to redirect vs. let 404 vs. merge
- **Edge cases**—products that changed significantly between platforms
- **Stakeholder communication**—explaining migration risks and timelines
- **Launch day coordination**—DNS changes, cache clearing, monitoring
- **Brand decisions**—how to handle URL structure changes that affect branding

## The Recommended Approach

Based on our testing, here's the optimal migration workflow:

1. **Planning and strategy**: Human SEO lead defines the migration plan
2. **URL mapping**: Devin AI (autonomous, accurate, fast)
3. **Schema implementation**: Claude Code (most accurate for Liquid + schema)
4. **Theme development**: Cursor Agents (best IDE integration)
5. **Pre-launch QA**: Devin AI (autonomous crawling and validation)
6. **Launch coordination**: Human team
7. **Post-launch monitoring**: Combination of AI agents and human review

## FAQs

- **Can any AI agent handle a migration completely alone?**
Not yet. AI handles 70-80% of the technical work, but strategic decisions, edge cases, and coordination still need humans.

- **How much does this reduce migration costs?**
Typically 50-70% cost reduction vs. a traditional agency migration, primarily through faster execution and less manual labor.

- **What about data security during AI-assisted migrations?**
Ensure AI agents don't expose sensitive customer data. Use sandboxed environments for testing.

- **Which is most cost-effective?**
Claude Code is cheapest (API-based pricing). Devin has a monthly subscription. Cursor is mid-range with a flat monthly fee.

## Conclusion

Autonomous AI agents can handle the majority of Shopify SEO migration work—URL mapping, schema implementation, and validation. Devin AI leads for fully autonomous tasks, Claude Code leads for code quality, and Cursor Agents lead for IDE-integrated development. The smart approach uses all three where each excels, with human oversight for strategic decisions.
