Seth Godin Remarkable to Rankable: A Practical Scorecard for SEO ContentEvery content marketer asks: “How do I go from Seth Godin-style remarkable content to truly rankable SEO content in 2024?” In this guide, I'll break down what it means to be both **remarkable** and **rankable**, using a practical SEO scorecard that blends Seth Godin’s legendary ideas with actionable content optimization, LLM SEO, and the latest on AI Overviews and SGE. If you’re tired of content that’s clever yet invisible on Google, you’re in the right place. Let’s get you seen.

I’ll cover why remarkable content alone isn’t enough, show you what rankability means now, share a battle-tested SEO scorecard, and give hands-on optimization steps that work for humans, search engines, and generative AI engines. We’ll also dig into [searchfit.ai’s](https://searchfit.ai/waitlist/blog) best practices, plus practical advice to help your team outshine AI Overview, SGE, and LLM SEO updates. Ready? Let’s dive in.

## 1. What Makes Content 'Remarkable' According to Seth Godin?

Seth Godin defines remarkable content as something worth talking about—content that sparks a reaction, gets shared, and makes readers feel connected. Here’s what that looks like in practice:

 - It solves unique problems or challenges your audience faces.
 - It’s written in an original, authentic voice—not just SEO filler.
 - It cuts through the noise with bold insights or unexpected angles.

Think of Godin’s work: He doesn’t regurgitate; he reframes and provokes. For SEO, this means your content must carry a strong POV and unique value—otherwise, you’re just another search result.

## 2. Why Remarkable Content Alone Doesn’t Rank (Anymore)

I’ve seen so many teams invest in “viral” or “remarkable” articles that vanish from SERPs because they ignore keyword mapping, SEO structure, or searcher intent. Seth Godin’s style grabs attention; SEO ensures you get that attention *from the right audience*.

Changes in algorithms (AI Overview, SGE, LLM-powered ranking factors) reward content that answers intent, is scannable for engines, and matches keyword language. In other words: being remarkable is just the start. Your content also needs to be discoverable.

## 3. What Is ‘Rankability’ in 2024?

Rankability is the likelihood your content will appear in top organic results, featured snippets, or generative AI answers. It's not just about keywords; it’s about:

 - **Search intent coverage**: Are you meeting what the user really wants?
 - **Semantic optimization**: Using related topics, not just exact matches.
 - **Authority and trust signals**: Backlinks, stats, credible sources.
 - **AI compatibility**: Formatting for LLMs, SGE extraction, and AI Overviews.

For step-by-step guides on increasing rankability, [see our enterprise SEO workflow optimization article](https://searchfit.ai/waitlist/blog/the-complete-guide-to-enterprise-seo-workflow-optimization/).

## 4. Why Seth Godin’s Ideas Matter for SEO—Now More Than Ever

The heart of SEO is winning attention—and nobody understands attention like Seth Godin. Why combine his approach with technical SEO?

 - Standing out in AI Overviews and SGE requires stronger hooks and emotional resonance.
 - Google's Helpful Content Update rewards originality and expertise—a Godin mindset.

If you skip the “remarkable” part, you’re just generating noise. But without optimization, your brilliant ideas remain unseen.

## 5. Introducing the SEO Scorecard: Remarkable to Rankable

I’ve developed a practical SEO scorecard based on Godin’s principles and modern search requirements. Here’s a preview you can use today:

 - **Remarkability (30%)**: Is it unique, bold, worth talking about?
 - **Intent Match (20%)**: Does it answer primary and secondary user intents?
 - **Keyword Relevance (15%)**: Are keywords mapped to real queries?
 - **Semantic Depth (10%)**: Includes LSI, FAQs, related questions?
 - **Technical SEO (10%)**: Page speed, schema, structure.
 - **AI Engine Friendliness (15%)**: Formatted for AI Overviews, SGE, LLMs?

Score your content in each area. Anything under 80%? Optimize before launch.

## 6. How to Measure Remarkability in Your SEO Content

Ask yourself:

 - Will a reader email, text, or share this to a friend?
 - Does it contain a bold insight or story not found elsewhere?
 - Are you saying what competitors aren’t?

Example: One SaaS client increased shares 500% after embedding a founder’s honest breakdown of failing their first product launch—remarkable, authentic stories that fuel SEO velocity.

## 7. What Are the New Rules for Keyword Research?

LSI, semantic, and intent-based keywords matter more than ever. Go beyond exact-match keywords. Here’s how to uncover modern keywords:

 - Analyze People Also Ask and related searches (for more, see [our long-tail keyword opportunity guide](https://searchfit.ai/waitlist/blog/how-to-find-long-tail-keywords-and-people-also-ask-opportunities/)).
 - Use tools for entity extraction (e.g., NLP APIs, Google’s Natural Language demo).
 - Map primary and secondary intent for each topic.

## 8. Optimizing Content Structure for SGE, AI Overview, and LLM SEO

Generative AI engines favor content that’s:

 - **Clear and modular**: Use headers (h2, h3), bullet points, and 1–3 sentence paragraphs.
 - **Fact-rich**: Include statistics, direct answers, and citations.
 - **Summarizable**: Lead with the answer, expand with details.

For a blueprint, [see our guide to SGE-ready content structures](https://searchfit.ai/waitlist/blog/seo-content-structure-tactics-for-sge/).

## 9. How to Write for Dual Audiences: Humans and AI

Seth Godin writes for humans; SEO strategists format for algorithms. To succeed:

 - Lead with story or human hook, then answer questions directly.
 - Lay out every section with descriptive H2s, easy to parse by AIs.
 - Use natural, conversational language, not keyword stuffing.

Real-world tip: Include FAQs, clear definitions, short how-tos—great for both readers and AIs summarizing your work.

## 10. Building Authority: Trust Signals for Modern SEO

Authority factors now include:

 - Mentions of credentials, expertise, or unique experience (show, don’t tell!)
 - Links to stats from trusted sites
 - Original data, case studies, unique images or charts

Originality + authority = maximum SEO impact.

## 11. Integrating Schema, Metadata, and Technical Basics

Technical SEO isn’t optional. Checklist for each post:

 - Meta title and description include primary and secondary keywords
 - Schema markup (FAQ, Article, Product, HowTo where relevant)
 - Alt text for unique images—describe, don’t stuff

Missed these? You’re invisible to SGE and AI Overviews.

## 12. Formatting and Layout for AI Overview Visibility

Layout tips for SGE and AI visibility:

 - Use short, scannable sections
 - Numbered steps or checklists for “how to” queries
 - Clear FAQs at the end

This makes content easier for LLMs to parse, increasing chances of wins in zero-click SERPs.

## 13. Generative Engine Optimization (GEO): Beyond Traditional SEO

GEO means optimizing for both search engines and LLMs. Here’s how:

 - Concise, authoritative answers (helpful for AI engines to “quote” you)
 - Inclusion of natural questions and answers within your content
 - Rich markup and conversational tone

For advanced tactics, [read our LLM SEO vs. traditional SEO comparison](https://searchfit.ai/waitlist/blog/llm-seo-vs-traditional-seo/).

## 14. The Power of Content Audits With a Scorecard

Regular audits with this scorecard turn guesswork into results:

 - Score each post: Update low-performing ones, retire the rest.
 - Benchmark remarkable content against what actually ranks.
 - Iterate weekly—not just quarterly.

This keeps your SEO flexible and fast-moving as algorithms change.

## 15. Using searchfit.ai Tools for Content Optimization

I use searchfit.ai’s analytics to:

 - Spot ranking drops after Google or SGE updates
 - Identify which content gets AI Overview visibility
 - Pinpoint under-optimized articles using scorecard metrics

## 16. Case Study: Transforming Remarkable Content for SERP Dominance

A B2B SaaS case:

 - Before: Founder-driven thought leadership—viral, not ranking.
 - After: Structured stories, targeted subtopics, FAQ schema.
 - Result: 120% organic traffic gain, multiple featured snippets, SGE inclusion.

Takeaway: Small tweaks + remarkability = SEO breakthroughs.

## 17. Common Mistakes to Avoid in Blending Seth Godin & SEO

 - Relying solely on “remarkability”—ignoring keywords and search structure.
 - Over-optimizing until you lose any human voice or emotion.
 - Missing AI Overviews/SGE by skipping schemas and Q&A formats.

Balance is key: Human at the core, optimized for discovery.

## 18. Keeping Up With AI Overview, SGE, and Algorithm Shifts

 - Subscribe to reliable sources (searchfit.ai, Search Engine Land)
 - Audit content monthly for emerging search features (FAQ carousels, AI Overviews)
 - Double down on unique insights—machines can replicate facts; only you can create perspective

## 19. Advanced: Prompt Engineering Tricks for LLM SEO

 - Write in a QA style—this helps LLMs extract your key points
 - Add "as a professional" or "expert tips" sections for authority
 - Summarize each section with a TL;DR for easy AI pulling

## FAQs

 - **What is remarkable content?**
Remarkable content is unique, shareable, and sparks real conversations. It stands out for its insight, storytelling, or value—echoing Seth Godin’s philosophy.
 - **Does remarkable content guarantee top rankings?**
No. While it may get shares, SEO content still needs optimization for search, SGE, and AI systems.

Use an SEO scorecard covering remarkability, intent match, keywords, semantic depth, technicals, and AI friendliness.
 - **What’s the difference between SEO content optimization and LLM SEO?**
Traditional SEO focuses on keywords and links. LLM SEO adds AI-oriented structure and conversational tone for SGE and AI Overview engines.

It often lacks keyword targeting, structured answers, and search intent mapping, making it hard to discover via organic search.

Monthly, or whenever there are Google/AI Overview updates. Continuous iteration wins.

Start with a hook or story, then section your content clearly with descriptive headers and FAQs—appealing to both humans and search engines.
