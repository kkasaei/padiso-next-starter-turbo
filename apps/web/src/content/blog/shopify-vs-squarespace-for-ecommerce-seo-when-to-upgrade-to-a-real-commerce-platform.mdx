Squarespace is beautiful. It's easy to use. And it's holding your ecommerce SEO back. If you've outgrown Squarespace and are considering Shopify, you're probably wondering whether the migration is worth the SEO risk. Spoiler: for stores serious about organic growth, the answer is almost always yes.

‍

## Where Squarespace Falls Short for Ecommerce SEO

Squarespace was built for websites, not ecommerce. The SEO limitations show:

### Product Page Limitations
- No metafield system for custom SEO data
- Limited product variant handling
- Basic product schema (missing many rich result properties)
- No programmatic content management API for AI tools

### Technical Constraints
- Limited URL structure customisation
- No robots.txt editing
- Basic sitemap (no image sitemap or video sitemap)
- No CDN optimisation controls
- Limited page speed tuning options

### Content Limitations
- Blog functionality is adequate but not commerce-optimised
- No native collection/category page editorial content areas
- Limited app/integration ecosystem
- No Shopify Flow-style automation

### Scale Limitations
- Performance degrades with large product catalogs (500+ products)
- No bulk content management tools
- Limited API for programmatic SEO operations
- No multi-currency or multi-language built-in

## Where Squarespace Is Perfectly Fine

Be honest about when Squarespace works:
- **Fewer than 50 products** with no growth ambitions
- **Portfolio or service businesses** with a small product shop
- **Content-first sites** where the blog is primary and products are secondary
- **Solo operators** who prioritise simplicity over capability

## When to Migrate to Shopify

Migration is worth it when:
- You have 100+ products (or plan to)
- Organic traffic is a priority growth channel
- You want to use AI SEO tools for automated optimisation
- You need multi-currency, multi-language, or marketplace selling
- Your page speed is suffering from catalog size
- You need structured data and schema beyond basic product markup

## The Migration Process

### Pre-Migration
1. Crawl your existing Squarespace site (capture all URLs)
2. Export all product data and content
3. Map Squarespace URLs to planned Shopify URLs
4. Document all existing meta titles, descriptions, and alt text

### Migration
1. Import products to Shopify
2. Recreate key pages and blog posts
3. Implement 301 redirects for all old URLs
4. Deploy schema markup on all page types
5. Configure Google Search Console for new domain/structure

### Post-Migration
1. Monitor indexation of new URLs
2. Track ranking changes for 90 days
3. Optimise any pages that lost rankings
4. Begin AI-powered content expansion (impossible on Squarespace)

## Expected Timeline

- **Weeks 1-2**: Ranking fluctuation (normal)
- **Weeks 3-6**: Recovery to pre-migration traffic levels
- **Weeks 7-12**: Surpass pre-migration traffic as Shopify advantages kick in
- **Month 4+**: Compounding growth from AI SEO capabilities

## SEO Features You Gain on Shopify

| Feature | Squarespace | Shopify |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Product schema depth | Basic | Comprehensive |
| AI SEO tool ecosystem | Very limited | Extensive |
| Programmatic content API | None | Full API |
| Metafields for custom data | None | Unlimited |
| Page speed (large catalogs) | Degrades | Consistently fast |
| Multi-currency SEO | None | Shopify Markets |
| Automation | None | Shopify Flow |

## FAQs

- **Will I lose rankings during migration?**
Temporary fluctuation is normal (2-4 weeks). With proper redirects, most stores recover within 6-8 weeks and then exceed pre-migration performance.

- **How much does migration cost?**
DIY: $0-500 (your time + Shopify subscription). Professional migration service: $2,000-10,000 depending on catalog size.

- **Can I keep my domain name?**
Yes—point your existing domain to Shopify. No URL change needed at the domain level.

- **Is it worth migrating if I only have 50 products?**
If you plan to grow beyond 100 products and want AI-powered SEO, yes. If you're staying small, Squarespace is fine.

## Conclusion

Squarespace is a great website builder. But for ecommerce businesses serious about organic growth, Shopify's SEO capabilities—especially when paired with AI tools—are in a different league. The migration involves short-term risk but delivers long-term SEO advantages that Squarespace simply can't match.
