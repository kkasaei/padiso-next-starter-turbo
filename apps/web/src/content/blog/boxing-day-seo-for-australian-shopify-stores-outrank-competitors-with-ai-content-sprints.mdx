Boxing Day is Australia's biggest shopping event—bigger than Black Friday for many categories. Yet most Australian Shopify stores do zero SEO preparation for December 26. While your competitors scramble with last-minute ads, an AI content sprint positions your store to capture the massive organic search traffic that Boxing Day generates. Here's the playbook.

‍

## Why Boxing Day SEO Matters in Australia

Boxing Day search behaviour in Australia:
- **"Boxing Day sales"** queries spike 10x in the week before December 26
- **Category + "Boxing Day"** queries drive high-intent traffic
- **"Boxing Day deals [product]"** converts at 3-5x normal rates
- **Post-Christmas gift card spending** drives additional January revenue

## The 3-Week Boxing Day SEO Sprint

### Week 1 (Early December): Create Landing Pages
- `/collections/boxing-day-sale` — main sale hub page
- Category-specific sale pages — "Boxing Day Fashion Deals," "Boxing Day Electronics Deals"
- Blog post: "Our Best Boxing Day Deals 2025 (Preview)"
- Submit all URLs for indexation immediately

### Week 2 (Mid December): Content and Links
- Publish "Boxing Day Shopping Guide" blog post
- Create "Boxing Day vs January Sales: When to Buy [Category]" comparison content
- Add homepage and navigation links to Boxing Day pages
- Internal link from product pages to relevant Boxing Day collections

### Week 3 (Pre-Boxing Day): Final Optimization
- Update sale pages with final pricing and product selection
- Optimise meta titles with "Boxing Day 2025" and current year
- Add sale-specific schema (priceValidUntil, sale pricing)
- Speed test all sale pages for traffic surge readiness

## Post-Boxing Day Strategy

Don't waste your Boxing Day SEO investment:
- Update pages to "Boxing Day Sale Ended — Shop January Clearance"
- Keep URLs live for next year's authority
- Redirect to New Year sale pages if applicable
- Capture email signups for next year's early access
