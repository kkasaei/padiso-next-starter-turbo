Ever wondered why your content isn’t generating the demand you expected, even when it’s ranking? That’s where **category design**—inspired by **Seth Godin**—blows traditional **search strategy** out of the water.

‍

In this post, I’ll show you why building a purple, remarkable category matters more than spinning up page after page—even in the era of AI Overview, SGE, and [product-led SEO](https://searchfit.ai/waitlist/blog/product-led-seo). We’ll break down the pivotal principles of Seth Godin SEO, how to create demand (not just harvest it), and actionable steps to build a category that search engines—and people—crave.

## What Is Seth Godin’s Take on Category Design in SEO?

Seth Godin believes it’s not about ranking for keywords; it’s about creating new ideas people talk about. In **category design**, you invent (not just compete). Instead of blue oceans, you build your own colored sea—a purple one.

- Design the category so you’re the only real choice
- Differentiate, don’t iterate
- Make the competition irrelevant by being incomparable

Think about how the iPod wasn’t just another MP3 player—it was a whole new category Apple owned.

## Why Is “Purple” Better Than Just Blue Ocean in Search?

A “purple” category is unforgettable, like Godin’s famous Purple Cow—something people can’t ignore. In search, blue ocean means unexplored markets, but purple categories are uncopyable ideas people talk about and seek out.

- Not just less competition—no real competition
- Your messaging shapes the demand
- You’re Google’s entity and people’s reference

Go purple, not just blue, to be truly differentiated online.

## How Does Category Design Work With Search Strategy?

Traditional search strategy finds keywords and fills gaps. With category design, you define the gap—then own it.

- Identify an under-addressed need
- Coin a term or sub-niche
- Build landing pages around educating searchers about the category

Instead of competing for SEO scraps, you create *the* table everyone wants to join. For more on blue ocean strategies in SEO, [see our blog post: Blue Ocean Strategy for SEO](https://searchfit.ai/waitlist/blog/blue-ocean-strategy-seo).

## How Can You Create Demand—Not Just Harvest It?

Most SEO chases demand already in Google. Godin-inspired thinkers **create** the demand themselves. Here’s how:

- Coin terms only you use
- Publish manifestos—content that stakes your claim
- Teach the problem, not just your solution
- Show how your category changes the game

Inventiveness, not iteration, builds durable search moats.

## What Happens When AI Overview & SGE Take Over?

AI Overview and SGE are changing how people discover. They combine content, summarize, and surface brands with strong authority. If you own a category, Google and AI will cite you as **the** reference—driving persistent, defensible traffic.

- Occupy the source position for new categories
- Be referenced in generative search experiences (GSE)

For future-proofing your SEO, category design is your moat in the age of AI.

## How Does Product-Led SEO Fit Into Category Design?

[Product-led SEO](https://searchfit.ai/waitlist/blog/product-led-seo) focuses on leveraging your product’s unique assets to scale organic visibility. Category design goes deeper: your product isn’t just another tool, it’s the **origin** of a new category.

- Your product becomes the blueprint for searches
- Landing pages educate on the category, tied directly to what you offer
- No product? No category. It’s a virtuous loop.

The more unique your product, the easier it is to shape and own the category online.

## Why “Pages” Alone Won’t Win in Modern Search

SEO playbooks used to say: make more pages, capture more demand. Just publishing pages is a commodity strategy. A purple category gives purpose and cohesion to your content, creating:

- Deeper reader engagement
- More links and citations
- Stronger expertise, authority, trust

Don’t just build pages—build movements.

## What Are the Steps to Building Your Own Purple Category?

Follow these Godin-inspired steps to carve your space:

- **Spot the unseen problem**—more than unmet, it’s unrecognized
- **Coin the name**—own the phrase, landing page, and initial definition
- **Publish thought leadership**—manifestos, explainers, and industry “primers”
- **Invite the tribe**—give practitioners a way to self-identify as part of the new category
- **Build defensible assets**—data studies, benchmarks, glossaries

Move beyond content to community.

## How to Use Language to Make a Category Stickier

Words shape searcher behavior. Seth Godin recommends creating a “vocabulary” around your new category. Some tactics:

- Invent memorable acronyms (e.g., “PLG” for product-led growth)
- Host a glossary or jargon buster page
- Use metaphors, like Godin’s “Purple Cow” story

Make your phrasing intuitive so others discuss—and search for—your new term.

## What Makes Category Design AI-Friendly?

AI engines value:

- Fresh, semantic-rich entities
- Original topic clusters (not copied)
- Clear answers to new questions
- Authority signals (links, references, thought leadership)

Design a category, and future AI models use your language as the basis for their results.

## How Do You Get Others to Adopt Your Category Language?

Getting your phrase to “catch on” requires strategic nudges:

- Host a workplace or industry challenge (“Are you a [category] leader yet?”)
- Encourage influencers and early adopters to use your term
- Publish industry “state of the [category]” reports
- Monitor mentions and reward community adoption

If people use your phrase without quoting you, you’ve nailed it.

## How to Anchor Your Category in Google’s Knowledge Graph

Google uses structured data, schema, and clear entity relationships to define categories. Here’s what to do:

- Add schema markup to new category pages
- Connect entities (people, companies, glossary terms) to your core page
- Submit to Wikidata or Wikipedia (if notability allows)

Become the canonical definition and you’ll be cited by both human and AI searchers.

## How Do You Build Authority Fast in a New Category?

Authority isn’t just links anymore, but relationships and citations. Speed up by:

- Creating data reports or benchmarks only you can access
- Getting early press coverage about your “new” thing
- Partnering with thought leaders for joint content

## How to Design Pillar Pages for Category Domination

Your pillar page is the home of the category:

- Explain what the category is and why it matters
- Show problem/solution fit with data, broken status quo, and clear outcomes
- Link to support content (how-to’s, stories, FAQs, comparison pages)
- Use visuals to reinforce new concepts

This becomes the “Wikipedia” of your purple category.

## How to Use Storytelling in SEO to Seed Your Category

People remember *stories* more than facts. Seth Godin’s work relies on memorable stories—Purple Cow, Tribes, and Linchpin.

- Tell customer success stories from your new category
- Share your origin—why did you invent this?
- Highlight “enemies” (old way vs. new category way)

Stories persuade, motivate, and drive adoption in search and social.

## What Are Common Pitfalls in Category Design for Search?

- Picking a category too similar to what already exists (no novelty)
- Coining a term nobody understands (too clever is a risk)
- Failing to get community or influencer buy-in
- Lack of ongoing content or support

Iterate, listen, and be ready to shift.

## How Do You Measure Success of a Purple Category?

- Brand searches—are people Googling your category name + brand?
- Mentions in third-party blogs and media (not just your own content)
- Share of voice in AI Overviews
- Organic growth of category keyword volume
- Conversion rates on category-focused pages

It’s about impact, not just impressions.

## What Does Category Design Look Like in Practice?

Back in the early days, Salesforce coined “No Software.” They didn’t fight other CRMs. They redesigned what a CRM could be—and owned the “cloud CRM” category.

- They published guides, hosted events, and spoke a new language
- Google started associating “CRM in the cloud” with Salesforce as the authority

You can do the same for your industry.

- Test phrasing variations in ads/content

- Use comparison pages (“Why X is better than Y”)
- Always stand ready to reframe—iteration is part of category design

Agility wins in early stages.
