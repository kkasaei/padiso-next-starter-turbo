Every ecommerce team in 2026 faces the same question: should we use GPT-5.2 or Claude 4.5 Sonnet for our SEO content? Both are exceptional LLMs, but they have different strengths that matter for different content types. I've tested both extensively across thousands of product descriptions, collection pages, blog posts, and schema markup. Here's the honest, data-backed comparison.

‍

## The Testing Methodology

To give you a fair comparison, I tested both models across five core ecommerce SEO content types:

1. **Product descriptions** (500 SKUs across 5 categories)
2. **Collection page content** (50 collection pages)
3. **Blog articles** (30 long-form posts, 2,000+ words each)
4. **Meta titles and descriptions** (500 pages)
5. **Schema markup generation** (200 Product + FAQ schemas)

Each test used identical inputs—same product data, same SEO briefs, same brand voice guidelines. Content was evaluated on: factual accuracy, brand voice consistency, SEO optimization, readability, and conversion potential.

## Product Descriptions: GPT-5.2 Wins

**GPT-5.2 score: 9/10 | Claude 4.5 Sonnet score: 8/10**

GPT-5.2 edges ahead for product descriptions because:

- **Superior instruction following**—format requirements (bullet count, character limits) are followed more consistently
- **Better with technical specs**—less likely to hallucinate product specifications
- **Efficient at scale**—batch API produces more consistent quality across 500+ descriptions

Claude 4.5 Sonnet produces slightly more engaging prose, but GPT-5.2's reliability at scale makes it the better choice for catalog-wide product content.

## Collection Page Content: Claude 4.5 Sonnet Wins

**GPT-5.2 score: 7.5/10 | Claude 4.5 Sonnet score: 9/10**

Collection pages need editorial quality—buying guides, comparison content, expert recommendations. This is where Claude 4.5 Sonnet shines:

- **More natural long-form writing**—reads like an expert wrote it, not an AI
- **Better topic exploration**—covers angles that GPT-5.2 misses
- **Stronger E-E-A-T signals**—naturally incorporates experience-based language
- **Superior synthesis**—can analyze 50+ products in a collection and write intelligently about the category

For collection pages, Claude 4.5 Sonnet produces content that feels authoritative and trustworthy.

## Blog Articles: Claude 4.5 Sonnet Wins

**GPT-5.2 score: 7/10 | Claude 4.5 Sonnet score: 9.5/10**

Blog content is Claude's strongest category:

- **Exceptional long-form quality**—2,000-5,000 word articles that maintain quality throughout
- **Natural keyword integration**—SEO keywords appear organically, never forced
- **Better structure**—heading hierarchy and content flow are more logical
- **Engaging opening hooks**—blog intros that actually make people want to read

GPT-5.2 blog content is competent but often reads as formulaic. Claude produces content that genuinely engages readers.

## Meta Titles and Descriptions: GPT-5.2 Wins

**GPT-5.2 score: 9.5/10 | Claude 4.5 Sonnet score: 8/10**

Short-form, high-precision content favors GPT-5.2:

- **Character count accuracy**—hits 55-60 character titles and 150-155 character descriptions consistently
- **Click optimization**—generates more compelling CTAs and power words
- **A/B variant quality**—produces 3-5 genuinely different variants per page
- **Scale consistency**—meta tags for product #500 are as good as product #1

## Schema Markup: Tie (Both Excellent)

**GPT-5.2 score: 9/10 | Claude 4.5 Sonnet score: 9/10**

Both models generate technically correct JSON-LD schema. Slight differences:

- **GPT-5.2**: Marginally better at complex nested schema with multiple entity types
- **Claude 4.5 Sonnet**: Better at extracting nuanced product attributes from unstructured descriptions

For schema generation, use whichever model you're already using for other tasks.

## What About Claude 4.6 Opus?

Claude 4.6 Opus—released February 7th, 2026—is Anthropic's most capable model. Where does it fit?

- **Best for**: Complex, high-stakes content where reasoning depth matters (pillar pages, strategy documents, multi-product comparisons)
- **Overkill for**: Standard product descriptions and meta tags
- **Cost**: Significantly more expensive per token than Claude 4.5 Sonnet

Use Claude 4.6 Opus for your top-tier content. Use Claude 4.5 Sonnet for volume production. Use GPT-5.2 for structured, precise output.

## Cost Comparison

Rough cost per 1,000 pieces of content:

| Content Type | GPT-5.2 Cost | Claude 4.5 Sonnet Cost |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Product descriptions (200 words) | ~$15 | ~$12 |
| Collection pages (1,000 words) | ~$40 | ~$35 |
| Blog posts (2,500 words) | ~$80 | ~$70 |
| Meta titles + descriptions | ~$5 | ~$5 |
| Schema markup | ~$10 | ~$10 |

Both are incredibly affordable compared to human copywriting ($50-200 per product description, $500-2,000 per blog post).
